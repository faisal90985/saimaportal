## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest Green (#388E3C), evoking community, nature, and growth.
- Background color: Off-White (#F5F5DC), provides a soft, clean backdrop that complements the green.
- Accent color: Burnt Orange (#D35400), serves as a vibrant contrast, drawing attention to key interactive elements and CTAs.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headers to give a modern, clear feel. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for body, as it ensures readability.
- Use simple, modern icons from a set like Material Icons or Font Awesome to represent categories and actions. Ensure icons are consistent in style and size throughout the app.
- Use a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Cards and sections should have consistent padding and margins to create a visually appealing and organized interface.
- Implement subtle animations, such as fade-in effects when loading new content or smooth transitions between tabs, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
